## Overview

Email Extraction is a Python project developed for extracting emails from Gmail accounts and saving them as a CSV file. The project is designed to work seamlessly with Gmail accounts and offers a user-friendly Streamlit interface for ease of use.

## Features

- **Email Extraction Script**: The repository includes the core Python script, `Email_Extraction.py`, which is responsible for the email extraction process. This script allows you to retrieve email data from your Gmail account efficiently.

- **Streamlit Web Interface**: The project leverages Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications, to provide an intuitive and interactive web interface. Users can input their email address and app password, select the mailbox (e.g., Inbox, Starred, Important, Sent), and specify a date range.

- **Data Analysis**: The extracted email data is processed, and key information such as subject, sender, date, and email body is collected. This data is then presented in tabular format for analysis and export.

- **Data Export**: The project enables users to export the extracted email data as a CSV file, making it easy to further analyze, visualize, or use the data for various purposes.
