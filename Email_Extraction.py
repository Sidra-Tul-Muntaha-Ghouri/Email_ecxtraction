    - Enter your Gmail **Email address** and **App password**.
    - You can then select a **mailbox** from the dropdown list.
    - Set a date range, and click the **Get Emails** button to initiate the extraction process.
    - The extracted email data will be displayed in a tabular format and can be downloaded via **Download** button. 
    - Remember to **Logout** after using the app.
